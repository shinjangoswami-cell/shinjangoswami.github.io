      <h3>LOOKING BACK AT 2025 | DATE:06/01/2026</h3>
        <p>
        The first writing of this blog, has come about a bit late and my sincere apologies for that. But I did require some to accumulate my feelings about last year and channelize them through screen text.
        I will be going into this month by month, so that the whole thing is a bit organized. Like always,

        January came first and overlapping my joy of a fresh new year, JEE 2025 was knocking at the door. Situation was, to be honest, a little bit scary because I knew very well that the road I built for succeeding in JEE had several potholes in it. Especially mathematics. Physics and Chemistry were fetching
        me easy marks, while I did have an immense lack of practice in Mathematics which was a big headache for me. Only JEE Aspirants can understand the kind of problem I was facing during that time, when one of three subjects you are appearing for is handicapped and you have to struggle with the other two only, honestly a hell of a ride. Adding to my misery, my exam centre was not my hometown (Burdwan), but about
        a 100 km away in Kolkata. Nevertheless, with a large empty bubble of false confidence, I stepped inside the hallowed gates of TCS Gitobitan, which either leaves a mark of happiness or pure misery.
        Now this bubble of mine suffered its first blow when I saw the number of students who were gonna appear with me for the exam, but the real deadly blow came in when I was about to attempt the first question
        in Physics. It was kind of simple, but my adrenaline during that point of time was making things go crazy. I knew that it was kind of over for me, January attempt of JEE 2025.

        February carried the hangovers of January, thing was that I knew what kind of terrorizing those 3 hours of JEE Mains were for me, but my parents didnt know. Even some of my friends were suffering the same problem. Great expectations crashing into the abyss of nothingness. That's what JEE does to you. I'm not saying its bad, in fact some describe it as the canon event of an engineer's life. Things like these build
        people. My JEE Results came and now my parents were depressed, same for my friends. It almost felt like someone was dead and I had some trouble believing that it was not me. Anyways, this grief had to be kicked off very very fast cause now the board exams were about to step in the show. For those who dont know, Board exams are not competitive like JEE. Some people weirdly classify it as the
        easier one. I am one of those weird people who do so. Physical Education, my first exam in AISSCE, class 12th boards of CBSE, I still remember the day how I was rushed to the exam centre (Narayana school) and I promised myself that I am not gonna screw this up (and to my surprise I actually didn't, I got a perfect score in Physical Education). February ended in a way that even the smallest sources of happiness 
        in my life was engulfed by the horror of JEE.

            March was more like as if I was on a survival mission, rather than enjoying my life. I knew I had to do something big ( well atleast above 90 percent marks ) or my confidence was gonna suffer a big crash. That in turn, would cause a huge damage as confidence is a very important resource during JEE period. Well, I am lucky that things worked out well according to my plan. My exams ended in the second last week of March
            as far as I remember, with JEE Mains 2nd attempt waiting round the corner in April.

            April started in the worst way possible but the end was pure drama. My JEE Mains Attempt 2 was kind of wasted too ( well some people would argue cause I cleared the cutoff but still the percentile was not upto my expectations...). Now the pressure began to build. I only had {...to be continued}
